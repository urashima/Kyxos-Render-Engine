# Execution Work Log

This file is append-only. Times use America/Los_Angeles unless explicitly stated.

## 2026-07-21 02:17 PDT — Phase 0 startup

### Completed

- Read `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, and `PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_PLAN.md` in full.
- Verified `urashima/Kyxos-Render-Engine` is accessible and private, with `main` as its default branch.
- Verified the baseline contains four commits, no existing phase branches, and no pull requests.
- Created remote branch `agent/phase-00-foundation` from `56c4f763407f4d1e8e6fbfd7ba14bcd6ec23b8b1`.
- Reconstructed the three canonical repository documents in the validation workspace.
- Defined the Phase 0 task graph and durable recovery files.

### Validation

- GitHub repository permissions: admin, maintain, pull, push, and triage confirmed.
- Canonical document line counts: README 43, development plan 1,842, acceptance plan 936.
- Runtime inventory: Node.js 24.14.0, Corepack 0.34.6, pnpm 11.7.0, npm 11.9.0.

### Issues and resolution

- The environment does not provide GitHub CLI or private-repository credentials for conventional `git clone`.
- This is not a development blocker: authenticated GitHub app operations are used for branch, commit, PR, CI, merge, and tag-facing repository work; the local workspace is used for implementation and validation.

### Next

- Commit and verify this execution baseline.
- Initialize the pnpm monorepo and strict TypeScript/tooling configuration.

## 2026-07-21 02:25 PDT — P0-01 and P0-02 execution/toolchain checkpoint

### Completed

- Added the pnpm workspace, exact runtime constraints, shared strict TypeScript configuration, ESLint flat configuration, and Prettier policy.
- Added repository ignores and a root TypeScript solution marker.
- Generated a deterministic `pnpm-lock.yaml` from exact dependency versions.
- Moved pnpm project policy into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, including a workspace-local store for sandbox and CI portability.

### Validation

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: PASS.
- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS under TypeScript strict mode.

### Issues and resolution

- Initial pnpm installation attempted to create `/root/.local`, which is outside the writable workspace. A project-local pnpm store resolved the environment-specific path issue.
- The first dependency selection included packages published inside the active minimum-release-age window. They were replaced with compatible stable versions (`typescript-eslint` 8.64.0 and Prettier 3.9.5), then the lockfile was rebuilt and reverified.
- TypeScript 6 rejects an empty root `files` list; a declaration-only solution marker now keeps the root project valid until package references are added.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the toolchain checkpoint.
- Scaffold the package manifests, TypeScript references, and public-only export map.

## 2026-07-21 02:28 PDT — P0-03 package boundary checkpoint

### Completed

- Added independently buildable packages for core, backend-api, backend-webgpu, frame-scheduler, renderer, sdk, and testing.
- Added exact workspace dependencies and TypeScript project references matching the required one-way architecture.
- Restricted every package export map to the public root entry point; private source subpaths are not exported.
- Added root package-build orchestration and a complete TypeScript solution graph.

### Validation

- `pnpm install`: PASS across eight workspace projects.
- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `pnpm build:packages`: PASS for all seven packages, including isolated package build scripts.
- Export-map audit: PASS; every package exposes only `.`.

### Performance

- No runtime code or GPU work was added; performance baseline is unchanged.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the package graph.
- Implement core ownership, lifecycle, typed event, stable error, and handle primitives with regression tests.
