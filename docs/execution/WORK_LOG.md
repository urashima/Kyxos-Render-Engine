# Execution Work Log

This file is append-only. Times use America/Los_Angeles unless explicitly stated.

## 2026-07-21 02:17 PDT — Phase 0 startup

### Completed

- Read `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, and `PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_PLAN.md` in full.
- Verified `urashima/Kyxos-Render-Engine` is accessible and private, with `main` as its default branch.
- Verified the baseline contains four commits, no existing phase branches, and no pull requests.
- Created remote branch `agent/phase-00-foundation` from `56c4f763407f4d1e8e6fbfd7ba14bcd6ec23b8b1`.
- Reconstructed the three canonical repository documents in the validation workspace.
- Defined the Phase 0 task graph and durable recovery files.

### Validation

- GitHub repository permissions: admin, maintain, pull, push, and triage confirmed.
- Canonical document line counts: README 43, development plan 1,842, acceptance plan 936.
- Runtime inventory: Node.js 24.14.0, Corepack 0.34.6, pnpm 11.7.0, npm 11.9.0.

### Issues and resolution

- The environment does not provide GitHub CLI or private-repository credentials for conventional `git clone`.
- This is not a development blocker: authenticated GitHub app operations are used for branch, commit, PR, CI, merge, and tag-facing repository work; the local workspace is used for implementation and validation.

### Next

- Commit and verify this execution baseline.
- Initialize the pnpm monorepo and strict TypeScript/tooling configuration.

## 2026-07-21 02:25 PDT — P0-01 and P0-02 execution/toolchain checkpoint

### Completed

- Added the pnpm workspace, exact runtime constraints, shared strict TypeScript configuration, ESLint flat configuration, and Prettier policy.
- Added repository ignores and a root TypeScript solution marker.
- Generated a deterministic `pnpm-lock.yaml` from exact dependency versions.
- Moved pnpm project policy into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, including a workspace-local store for sandbox and CI portability.

### Validation

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: PASS.
- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS under TypeScript strict mode.

### Issues and resolution

- Initial pnpm installation attempted to create `/root/.local`, which is outside the writable workspace. A project-local pnpm store resolved the environment-specific path issue.
- The first dependency selection included packages published inside the active minimum-release-age window. They were replaced with compatible stable versions (`typescript-eslint` 8.64.0 and Prettier 3.9.5), then the lockfile was rebuilt and reverified.
- TypeScript 6 rejects an empty root `files` list; a declaration-only solution marker now keeps the root project valid until package references are added.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the toolchain checkpoint.
- Scaffold the package manifests, TypeScript references, and public-only export map.

## 2026-07-21 02:28 PDT — P0-03 package boundary checkpoint

### Completed

- Added independently buildable packages for core, backend-api, backend-webgpu, frame-scheduler, renderer, sdk, and testing.
- Added exact workspace dependencies and TypeScript project references matching the required one-way architecture.
- Restricted every package export map to the public root entry point; private source subpaths are not exported.
- Added root package-build orchestration and a complete TypeScript solution graph.

### Validation

- `pnpm install`: PASS across eight workspace projects.
- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `pnpm build:packages`: PASS for all seven packages, including isolated package build scripts.
- Export-map audit: PASS; every package exposes only `.`.

### Performance

- No runtime code or GPU work was added; performance baseline is unchanged.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the package graph.
- Implement core ownership, lifecycle, typed event, stable error, and handle primitives with regression tests.

## 2026-07-21 03:44 PDT — P0-04 core contract checkpoint

### Completed

- Added stable engine error codes, module attribution, recovery metadata, serialization, and unknown-error wrapping.
- Added an idempotent LIFO disposal bag that attempts every cleanup and aggregates multiple failures.
- Added a synchronous typed event emitter with snapshot delivery, one-shot listeners, idempotent unsubscribe, and deterministic disposal.
- Added immutable monotonic typed handles that do not reuse IDs, plus runtime validation and stable diagnostic keys.
- Exposed only the intended public contracts through the core package root.

### Validation

- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS under strict TypeScript settings.
- `pnpm test:unit`: PASS — 4 files and 12 tests.
- `pnpm build:packages`: PASS for all seven packages.

### Issues and resolution

- The previous execution ended after writing the P0-04 working files but before committing them. The remote branch remained intact at P0-03; the local snapshot was recovered and revalidated against that exact branch head.
- GitHub CLI is unavailable in the execution image. Authenticated GitHub connector Git-data operations remain the established non-blocking publish path.

### Performance

- Core primitives allocate no GPU resources and introduce no frame loop. Event delivery is synchronous and proportional to active listeners.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the P0-04 checkpoint.
- Implement backend capabilities, lifecycle state, resource creation/destruction contracts, and a deterministic accounting mock.

## 2026-07-21 03:51 PDT — P0-05 backend contract and mock checkpoint

### Completed

- Added a backend-neutral lifecycle and event contract that does not expose `GPUDevice`, WebGL contexts, or other native objects.
- Added immutable capability reports with explicit backend availability, conservative feature defaults, and normalized limits.
- Added opaque resource handle kinds and active/total count plus estimated-byte diagnostics.
- Added a deterministic Mock Backend with initialization, state transitions, resource ownership, idempotent destruction, loss simulation, reinitialization, and disposal.
- Added backend contract and Mock Backend regression tests, including unavailable backend and active-resource baseline checks.

### Validation

- Clean `pnpm clean` followed by `pnpm test:unit`: PASS.
- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS for package source and test source.
- `pnpm test:unit`: PASS — 6 files and 21 tests.
- All seven packages built successfully before the test run.
- Mock resource baseline after explicit destruction, device loss, and backend disposal: 0 active resources and 0 active estimated bytes.

### Issues and resolution

- Running package compilation and unit tests concurrently allowed Vitest to resolve stale workspace `dist` output. The test command now builds packages first, and a clean-build regression run proves it has no hidden dependency on previous artifacts.

### Performance

- No frame loop or GPU work was added. Resource statistics scan active mock records only when diagnostics are requested.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the P0-05 checkpoint.
- Implement the dirty-driven scheduler shell, renderer registrations, and SDK-only factory/consumer flow.

## 2026-07-21 04:01 PDT — P0-06 scheduler, renderer, and SDK checkpoint

### Completed

- Added the full Dirty Flag vocabulary and a driver-injected foundation Frame Scheduler.
- Added coalesced one-frame invalidation, wake/sleep events, explicit suspension, pending-frame cancellation, and idempotent disposal without a permanent RAF loop.
- Added Renderer lifecycle, typed events, diagnostics, backend-loss handling, and resource-owning disposal.
- Added `registerRenderFeature`, `registerMaterialExtension`, `registerAssetDecoder`, and `registerPreviewPreset` with stable duplicate-ID failures and unregister/dispose ownership.
- Added the public `createKyxosRenderer` SDK factory and isolated browser frame-driver adapter.
- Added a public-entry-only SDK consumer test plus scheduler and Mock Backend renderer integration tests.

### Validation

- `pnpm format:check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with zero warnings.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS for source and tests.
- `pnpm test:unit`: PASS — 9 files and 28 tests.
- All seven packages built successfully before the test run.
- Two invalidations before a frame produced one pending request and one emitted frame.
- Renderer returned to Sleeping after the frame; Backend Lost and Dispose both canceled pending work.
- Renderer Dispose returned Mock Backend active resource count and estimated bytes to zero.
- SDK-only fixture imported exclusively from the SDK root entry and completed create/invalidate/frame/dispose.

### Performance

- Idle state schedules zero frames. Multiple synchronous invalidations are coalesced into one frame request.
- No DOM, React, Texture Lab, or global RAF dependency entered Renderer Core.

### Next

- Commit and remotely verify the P0-06 checkpoint.
- Build the framework-independent Vite Playground and `/acceptance/phase-00` route, then run browser smoke checks.
