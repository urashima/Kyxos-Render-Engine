- **Current Phase:** Phase 4 — Frame Scheduler, TAA, and Static Accumulation (In Development)
- **Current Branch:** `agent/phase-04-temporal` / Draft PR #7
- **Overall Progress:** 4 / 15 phases accepted; P4-01 through P4-11 verified; P4-12 lifecycle stabilization is ready for authoritative CI
- **Current Task:** P4-12 — Public Temporal PBR Canvas lifecycle and Phase 4 acceptance Playground
- **Last Completed Task:** P4-11 — ordered PBR MRT → Dynamic TAA → optional Static Accumulation → Present transaction with native Scheduler/WebGPU evidence
- **Next Action:** Push the lifecycle checkpoint, require standard CI to pass all 33 pinned browser/WebGPU cases, then freeze the P4-12 visual/performance/lifecycle acceptance package
